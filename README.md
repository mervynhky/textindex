# Text Indexing

To start, go to this file:
```
2011/11/pdftotext/example/index.html
```
**Right+click** and open in browser (**FIREFOX**)
chrome rather buggy but you can try.

Configurations can be made inside the **index.html** file itself.
To get the position, the function name is 
```
getPosition()
```
To get the length, probably do something like 
```
window.getSelection().length;
```

For the full thing, it is inside the **experiment** branch. very unstable for now.
It includes the **pagination** (also very unstable).
