To start, go to this file

2011/11/pdftotext/example/index.html

right click and open in browser (FIREFOX)
chrome rather buggy but you can try.

Configurations can be made inside the index.html file itself.
To get the position, the function name is getPosition().
To get the length, probably do something like 
window.getSelection().length;

for the full thing, it is inside the experiment branch. very unstable for now.
it includes the pagination (also very unstable).
